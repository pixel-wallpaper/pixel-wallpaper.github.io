Here, vibrant Japanese maple trees and serene bamboo forests create a harmonious blend of color and tranquility. These maples, known for their delicate, deeply lobed leaves, turn fiery shades of red, orange, and gold during fall, attracting visitors from around the world. They are celebrated not only for their beauty but also for their cultural symbolism\u2014representing elegance, peace, and the fleeting nature of life.</description></item><item><title>Herds of heritage</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bisonsprings_en-us6080228013_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bisonsprings_en-us6080228013_uhd/</guid><description>The bison embodies a paradox: immense strength paired with quiet calm. Weighing up to 2,000 pounds and standing 6 feet tall, these giants roam North America&amp;#39;s grasslands and river valleys in mobile herds. Photographed here in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, they once numbered in the tens of millions but were nearly eradicated in the 19th century—a loss that reshaped ecosystems and disrupted lifeways.</description></item><item><title>Under the Halloween spell</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.brancastle_en-us5914201029_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.brancastle_en-us5914201029_uhd/</guid><description>Tonight, Halloween casts its spell—and only a few places on Earth carry a mystery quite like Bran Castle in Romania. The fortress was built in the 14th century and has withstood wars, monarchs, and shifting empires. But here, legends speak louder than history. Perched between the regions of Transylvania—renowned for its chilling tales—and Wallachia, once ruled by Vlad III Dracula, the castle evokes a haunting legacy. Vlad&amp;#39;s ruthless reputation inspired Bram Stoker&amp;#39;s 1897 Gothic novel &amp;#39;Dracula.&amp;#39; Though the story is not set at Bran Castle, its looming form and persistent rumors of Vlad&amp;#39;s presence blur fact and legend, forever linking it to one of humanity&amp;#39;s most enduring tales.</description></item><item><title>Hooves, hues, and heritage</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.pushkarfair_en-us4430814252_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.pushkarfair_en-us4430814252_uhd/</guid><description>Every fall, the desert town of Pushkar in Rajasthan, India, comes alive with one of the most colorful gatherings—the Pushkar Camel Fair. Timed with the Hindu lunar month of Kartik, it usually takes place between late October and early November on the Gregorian calendar. This year, the celebrations stretch from today until November 5, marking the region&amp;#39;s most anticipated season.</description></item><item><title>Rooted in time</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.fanalforest_en-us4405104404_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.fanalforest_en-us4405104404_uhd/</guid><description>The Portuguese island of Madeira\u2014about 600 miles southwest of mainland Portugal\u2014hides a forest unlike any other. On its northern slopes lies Fanal Forest, where veils of mist drift through centuries-old til trees. These are part of the Laurissilva of Madeira\u2014an outstanding relict of a once widespread laurel forest type. Laurissilva is the largest surviving area of its kind, with about 90% considered primary forest. Home to a unique array of plants and animals, including endemic species such as the Madeiran long-toed pigeon, it remains a living museum of natural history.</description></item><item><title>A gateway to stone wonders</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.teplicerocks_en-us4098225022_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.teplicerocks_en-us4098225022_uhd/</guid><description>From 18th-century visitors to fire-carved trails, this rock city tells a story of survival. Hidden in Czechia&amp;#39;s Hradec Králové Region, the Adršpach–Teplice Rocks form Central Europe&amp;#39;s largest sandstone labyrinth. For centuries, the cliffs and passages lay cloaked in forest, until a great fire stripped the land bare. Arches, towers, and winding corridors emerged out of the ashes, and the first hiking paths were carved into the rock. Soon after, explorers and poets left their marks with stone inscriptions that captured a destination both wild and enchanting.</description></item><item><title>Bigger, bolder, beakier</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.africanraven_en-us4057369898_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.africanraven_en-us4057369898_uhd/</guid><description>Perched high in the mountains of Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia, the thick-billed raven holds the title of the world&amp;#39;s largest raven. At nearly 28 inches in length and weighing more than 3 pounds, it is about a quarter heavier than the common raven. Its enormous, arched bill—pale at the base and close to 3.5 inches long—is the largest among perching birds. These ravens live mostly between 5,000 and 11,200 feet above sea level, found across farmland, rocky cliffs, and even rooftops in mountain towns.</description></item><item><title>Oh my gourd, it's today!</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.pumpkinfarm_en-us3773448576_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.pumpkinfarm_en-us3773448576_uhd/</guid><description>Nothing says fall like spotting a field full of pumpkins waiting to be picked. These gourds have rolled their way into pies, porches, lattes, and parades, but today they get the spotlight: It&amp;#39;s National Pumpkin Day. Some places go all out to show their affection—Morton, Illinois, calls itself the &amp;#39;Pumpkin Capital of the World,&amp;#39; thanks to its high production and ties to canned pumpkin. New Hampshire follows closely, with pumpkin as its official state fruit.</description></item><item><title>Finland's living peatland</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.martimoaapafinland_en-us3685817058_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.martimoaapafinland_en-us3685817058_uhd/</guid><description>Today, we step into the Martimoaapa Mire Reserve in Finland, where wide, cold-climate wetlands and peatlands stretch across a landscape shaped over thousands of years. This reserve is more than just mires—it carries layers of history. During Finland&amp;#39;s Prohibition era (1919–1932), smugglers hauled sacks of liquor from Sweden across these bogs, following a &amp;#39;spirits&amp;#39; route that passed through Martimoaapa. Parts of that path can still be traced today. Imagine trekking with a heavy pack over soggy ground—would you have made it?</description></item><item><title>From 'Grey Ghost' to ghost stories</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.queenmary_en-us3331250680_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.queenmary_en-us3331250680_uhd/</guid><description>She was never meant to fade away. When the RMS Queen Mary sailed in 1936, she stole the spotlight across the Atlantic—an Art Deco liner that broke speed records and carried celebrities, royalty, and dignitaries. War transformed her from a floating palace into the &amp;#39;Grey Ghost,&amp;#39; stripped of luxury and loaded with Allied troops. In 1967, after 30 years at sea, she retired to Long Beach, where her decks now serve as hotel corridors, guided exhibits, and a living monument to maritime history.</description></item><item><title>Snow much love</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.snowleopard_en-us3294064537_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.snowleopard_en-us3294064537_uhd/</guid><description>Ever tried spotting a snow leopard in the wild? It&amp;#39;s called the &amp;#39;ghost of the mountains&amp;#39; for a reason—you&amp;#39;re more likely to see its pawprints than the big cat itself. But every October 23, the species steps into the spotlight on International Day of the Snow Leopard, a day set aside to protect this elusive predator and its rugged home.</description></item><item><title>Set in stone</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bulgariarocks_en-us3184562282_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bulgariarocks_en-us3184562282_uhd/</guid><description>In Bulgaria, on the western slopes of the Balkan Mountains, the Belogradchik Rocks stand like a natural gallery where every formation tells a tale. Shaped over millions of years by erosion, these sandstone and limestone pillars twist and tower into outlines that locals swear resemble people, animals, and even entire scenes. That&amp;#39;s why names like &amp;#39;The Horseman,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;The Schoolgirl,&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;The Monks&amp;#39; have stuck—it&amp;#39;s a landscape where spotting shapes feels a bit like playing nature&amp;#39;s version of charades.</description></item><item><title>Glowing traditions</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.diyadiwali_en-us3108369974_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.diyadiwali_en-us3108369974_uhd/</guid><description>Diwali is a vibrant Hindu festival celebrating hope, prosperity, and the triumph of good over evil. It commemorates Prince Rama&amp;#39;s victorious return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana. The festival also honors the goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring wealth and well-being into homes, while some communities worship the goddess Kali. During Diwali, families clean and decorate their homes, exchange sweets, and gather for prayers, creating an atmosphere of joy. Central to the celebration are diyas, small oil lamps whose glowing flames symbolize light overcoming darkness and the promise of new beginnings.</description></item><item><title>Life in the slow lane</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.hoffmanssloth_en-us3030106938_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.hoffmanssloth_en-us3030106938_uhd/</guid><description>How good would it feel if you could just hang out and do absolutely nothing all day? That&amp;#39;s exactly what sloths do, and today, we celebrate them. International Sloth Day honors these unhurried creatures and reminds us that life doesn&amp;#39;t always need to be rushed. Sloths are tree-dwelling mammals native to Central and South America. Their deliberate movements conserve energy, avoid predators, and even allow algae to grow on their fur, creating green camouflage among the canopy. Hoffmann&amp;#39;s two-toed sloth, pictured here, is a prime example of the slow-paced lifestyle typical of all sloths. It spends most of its time in the trees, occasionally descending to the ground to move to a new one.</description></item><item><title>Sweet on science</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.appleharvest_en-us2977882687_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.appleharvest_en-us2977882687_uhd/</guid><description>In Minnesota, autumn carries more than crimson leaves—it brings the crisp promise of apple season. From mid-August through late October, orchards across the state open their rows of Honeycrisp, Haralson, and dozens of other cultivars, each bred for flavor, resilience, and charm. Today&amp;#39;s image captures that moment: branches heavy with ripe fruit, ready for harvest.</description></item><item><title>The hill that remembers</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.silburyhill_en-us2485144120_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.silburyhill_en-us2485144120_uhd/</guid><description>Each year, International Archaeology Day—observed on the third Saturday of October—invites us to literally look beneath the surface.

In the Upper Peninsula, humans have left their traces for millennia: Indigenous Algonquian-speaking peoples were followed by French and British explorers, and waves of Finnish, Swedish, and French-Canadian immigrants settled there during the 19th-century mining and logging booms. Today, this sparsely populated region hosts barely 3% of Michigan&amp;#39;s residents, cradling its forests and waterfalls in near-natural serenity.</description></item><item><title>The phantom cat</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.siberianlynx_en-us0696336220_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.siberianlynx_en-us0696336220_uhd/</guid><description>Think of a cat that can vanish into the forest without a sound—that&amp;#39;s the Eurasian lynx. With its tufted ears and a piercing gaze, this feline is the largest of the four lynx species. Stretching up to 42 inches in length and standing as tall as 30 inches at the shoulder, the Eurasian lynx is built for power and precision. Its padded paws aren&amp;#39;t just for sneaking; they act like snowshoes, spreading its weight so it can chase down prey in deep winter drifts. Mostly a nocturnal hunter, it spends its days tucked away in thickets or rocky dens, venturing out under the cover of darkness to stalk deer, hares, and squirrels.</description></item><item><title>The spore the merrier</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.amethystlaccaria_en-us0640413961_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.amethystlaccaria_en-us0640413961_uhd/</guid><description>Did you know there&amp;#39;s a day just for mushrooms? Every October 15, National Mushroom Day invites us to discover their fascinating world. Take the amethyst laccaria, pictured here. Also known as the amethyst deceiver, its bright purple color is dazzling when young, but it fades with age and weathering, making it tricky to identify. Despite its delicate, ever-changing appearance, this jewel-toned fungus is edible and plays a vital role in the ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Dreams painted in blue and white</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.oiasantorini_en-us0585833457_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.oiasantorini_en-us0585833457_uhd/</guid><description>Ever wondered what it&amp;#39;s like to live on a movie set? Oia is about as close as it gets, part of Greece&amp;#39;s Santorini archipelago. This village has appeared in films like &amp;#39;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Tomb Raider,&amp;#39; thanks to its Cycladic houses—cube-shaped homes with flat roofs—and cliffside views that feel almost unreal. Its unique architecture has roots in the late 19th century. Sailors and merchants carved houses right into the volcanic cliffs—cool in summer and warm in winter. The white-and-blue theme is also more than just for show: houses were painted with lime wash so rainwater would run off and be collected. Today, visitors wander its cobbled lanes, explore the Naval Maritime Museum, or climb to the ruins of Agios Nikolaos Castle for unforgettable sunsets.</description></item><item><title>Flames of the past</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.mulecanyon_en-us0527899523_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.mulecanyon_en-us0527899523_uhd/</guid><description>Canyons and mesas across the US hold more than striking scenery—they carry centuries of Indigenous history. Indigenous Peoples&amp;#39; Day, celebrated nationally on the second Monday of October, honors that history. The holiday began gaining ground in 1992, when Berkeley, California, became the first city to replace Columbus Day with a celebration of Native cultures. It recognizes Native nations as the earliest protectors of the land and acknowledges their ongoing cultural contributions.</description></item><item><title>Falling for Saranac</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.saranaclake_en-us0445660450_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.saranaclake_en-us0445660450_uhd/</guid><description>Some places are just stops on the map, but Saranac Lake in New York&amp;#39;s Adirondack Mountains is a destination that keeps people hooked year-round. Despite its name, this village isn&amp;#39;t directly on the Saranac Lakes themselves but rather on Lake Flower, a wide section of the Saranac River. For centuries, the area—nicknamed &amp;#39;The Capital of the Adirondacks&amp;#39;—was used by Indigenous peoples for hunting and travel. By the late 19th century, it gained fame as a health retreat, where Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau pioneered fresh-air treatment for tuberculosis. The cure cottages from that era still stand today.</description></item><item><title>Nest stop, Mexico!</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.woodduckhen_en-us0382439406_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.woodduckhen_en-us0382439406_uhd/</guid><description>Birds don&amp;#39;t bother with passports, visas, or luggage—they just spread their wings and go. Twice a year, billions of migratory birds crisscross the globe, flying thousands of miles between breeding and wintering grounds. That epic commute is exactly what World Migratory Bird Day highlights. From the Arctic tern, which logs about 44,000 miles a year, to the tiny ruby-throated hummingbird crossing the Gulf of Mexico in a single flight, these seasonal fliers show what endurance really looks like. Observed on the second Saturday in May and October, the day also draws attention to the challenges migratory birds face: habitat loss, climate change, and light pollution can all disrupt their routes.</description></item><item><title>A reef of reflection</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.monurikifiji_en-us0326449622_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.monurikifiji_en-us0326449622_uhd/</guid><description>Some dates mark a single milestone—Fiji&amp;#39;s October 10 marks two. On that day in 1874, the islands officially became a British colony. Almost a century later, in 1970, the same date saw Fiji raise its own flag and declare independence. Fiji Day is a unique national holiday—part reflection, part celebration. The day begins with formal ceremonies, where the Fijian flag is hoisted and leaders deliver speeches. Schools and community groups often stage reenactments and performances. Streets fill with parades, villages host cultural dances like the meke, and rugby pitches come alive with matches. Families prepare traditional dishes like lovo, where meat and root crops are cooked underground, and kokoda, a citrus-marinated fish dish.</description></item><item><title>Universe in bloom</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.webbpillars_en-us0251661895_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.webbpillars_en-us0251661895_uhd/</guid><description>As World Space Week draws to a close, the cosmos continues to give us reasons to look up in awe.

The change usually begins in September and early October, with higher slopes turning first, followed by the lower valleys. Among the stars of this display are the aspens, whose leaves shimmer like gold coins in the sunlight. The magic of aspen colors, however, isn&amp;#39;t guaranteed year after year. Their golden glow depends on many factors—tree health, local weather shifts, soil moisture, and where they grow in terms of elevation and latitude. Healthy aspens are the true stars of the season: strong, thriving groves burst with brighter colors and hold onto their leaves longer, while stressed or weakened trees often fade quickly, offering only a glimpse of their usual brilliance. Today&amp;#39;s image captures their full glow at the base of Mount Sneffels, the highest peak in Colorado&amp;#39;s Sneffels Range, rising more than 7,000 feet above the town of Ridgway.</description></item><item><title>To the moon and back</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.anshunbridge_en-us0059795497_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.anshunbridge_en-us0059795497_uhd/</guid><description>The shiver felt under a full autumn moon, when the air hints at winter&amp;#39;s arrival, has a way of lingering in memory. One of China&amp;#39;s most cherished holidays, the Mid-Autumn Festival—also known as the Moon Festival—adds another touch of magic to the end of the harvest season. It&amp;#39;s celebrated on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month of the Chinese calendar—this year, on October 6.

On the Isle of Skye, Scotland&amp;#39;s fabled &amp;#39;Misty Isle,&amp;#39; the glen stretches in a sweep of purple heather carpeting its rugged slopes. The landscape hums with echoes of the past: dinosaurs left footprints on these cliffs long before Mesolithic hunters traced its streams over 8,000 years ago. In the 9th century, seafaring Norse Vikings settled here. Centuries later, the powerful MacLeod and MacDonald clans claimed these lands, their castles standing guard over countless battles and alliances.</description></item><item><title>Wild by law</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.oxbowbend_en-us8471628790_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.oxbowbend_en-us8471628790_uhd/</guid><description>Beyond water, rivers carry life, history, and stories.

A member of the Ramphastidae family, which includes toucan barbets, it is one of more than 40 toucan species. Found from southern Mexico to northern Colombia, it spends much of its day plucking fruit with a rainbow-colored bill about one-third of its total length. It also eats insects, eggs, and small reptiles when available. The bill not only helps it eat but also keeps the toucan cool by radiating excess heat—thanks to the blood vessels running through it. This social bird often moves in small groups, chattering and gliding between treetops. With each wing measuring 7–8 inches, the keel-billed toucan molts, or sheds its feathers, just once a year.</description></item><item><title>Midway to winter</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.aspenequinox_en-us8237887036_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.aspenequinox_en-us8237887036_uhd/</guid><description>Fall isn&amp;#39;t just marked by the calendar. Each September, Earth&amp;#39;s subtle tilt brings the autumn equinox—one of two times a year when day and night are nearly equal in length. It marks the beginning of fall in the Northern Hemisphere. From solar alignments to changing leaves, nature offers its own quiet signals that the season has shifted. While for most of us it may seem like just another day, ancient cultures paid close attention to this change.

They all played a role in one of the greatest environmental comebacks in history. Seen from 225 miles above, the Gulf Coast glows like a constellation—clusters of light scattered across the dark. But what truly makes this view possible can&amp;#39;t be seen: the ozone layer, silently shielding everything below from the sun&amp;#39;s ultraviolet rays. By the 1980s, that shield was thinning fast—damaged by chemicals once used in refrigeration and aerosol products. The solution? A global pact. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking.

Once the site of a bustling market square known as the Plaza del Arrabal, this historic space has witnessed the city&amp;#39;s transformation over the centuries. The shift began in 1561, when the plaza came under Madrid&amp;#39;s jurisdiction after the royal court moved from Toledo. Inspired by a vision of order and grandeur, King Philip II reimagined the square—though construction did not actually begin until 1617, under the reign of Philip III.</description></item><item><title>This egret has no regrets</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.whiteegret_en-us3605994040_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.whiteegret_en-us3605994040_uhd/</guid><description>They wear white after Labor Day\u2014and all year long\u2014with zero shame.

But instead of magic wands, it was limestone, mortar-free masonry, and—according to some theories—a bit of tax evasion that built this town&amp;#39;s signature homes: the trulli. These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It&amp;#39;s an ancient building technique, and in this case, a clever one. Back in the 14th century, locals were reportedly trying to avoid property taxes by constructing homes that could be quickly dismantled when the king&amp;#39;s tax collector came around.</description></item><item><title>From volcanic roots to river routes</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.yellowstoneriver_en-us3380364726_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.yellowstoneriver_en-us3380364726_uhd/</guid><description>Today, the National Park Service celebrates another trip around the sun—and nearly 85 million acres of American beauty under its care.

These ground-dwelling songbirds are known for their upright posture and habit of hopping or sprinting between perches. Despite the name, wheatears have nothing to do with wheat or ears—the name is a twist on the old phrase &amp;#39;white arse,&amp;#39; pointing to the bird&amp;#39;s distinctive white rump found in most species. The northern wheatear weighs less than an ounce, but travels thousands of miles between its summer homes in Alaska and northern Canada to its wintering grounds in Africa. Its migration route is one of the longest for a bird its size. Unlike many backyard songbirds, wheatears prefer wide-open spaces with low vegetation, where they can sprint and pounce on insects. And while most North American birders might only catch them in the far north, wheatears are widespread across Europe, Asia, and Africa.</description></item><item><title>Built to last</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.citadelbonifacio_en-us2046177235_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.citadelbonifacio_en-us2046177235_uhd/</guid><description>Set at Corsica&amp;#39;s southern edge, Bonifacio looks out across a narrow strait to Sardinia, its limestone cliffs towering above the waves.

Established in 828 CE by Boniface II of Tuscany, the commune gradually became a meeting point for traders, soldiers, and sailors—each group contributing to the evolution of the town&amp;#39;s structure. Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the &amp;#39;vieille ville&amp;#39; (old town)—also known as &amp;#39;la Haute Ville&amp;#39; (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls.

National Aviation Day gives us a reason to pause and appreciate how aviation has shaped the modern world—and the innovators who dared to dream of flight. The national day was established in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to honor Orville Wright&amp;#39;s contributions to aviation. Wright, born on this day in 1871, achieved the first powered, controlled flight in 1903 along with his brother Wilbur.

Tucked away in New York&amp;#39;s Adirondack High Peaks, this 9-acre alpine lake sits at nearly 2,900 feet between Mount Colden and Avalanche Mountain. Shaped by ancient glaciers, the lake is framed by dramatic cliffs and rugged terrain that echo its icy origins. Its most striking feature is the Trap Dike—a towering 1,200-foot rock canyon flanked by steep walls, making the lake one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the Adirondacks. Massive avalanches carved these cliffs, leaving behind the dramatic landscape that gave Avalanche Lake its name. The Avalanche Lake Trail begins at the Adirondack Loj, a well-known launch point for adventures in the High Peaks. Spanning about 9.6 miles round trip with a 1,350-foot elevation gain, the hike may seem manageable on paper—but it&amp;#39;s the uneven terrain that truly tests your mettle.</description></item><item><title>One tall way to spot the sea</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.lyngviglighthouse_en-us1600601632_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.lyngviglighthouse_en-us1600601632_uhd/</guid><description>Built to brave storms and steer ships to safety, lighthouses now glow as symbols of heritage, wonder, and connection.

Gliding through the ocean with flapping fins and polka-dot flair, the spotted eagle ray refuses to blend in. It doesn&amp;#39;t crawl along the seabed like its stingray cousins—it flies underwater. The species gets its name from—you guessed it—its protruding snout, which resembles an eagle&amp;#39;s beak, and its distinctive spotted back, which is unique to each individual, much like fingerprints. Their wing-like pectoral fins can span up to 10 feet. Near the base of the long tail are venomous spines, in case a predator gets too close. These rays aren&amp;#39;t aggressive, but they&amp;#39;re not defenseless either.</description></item><item><title>Taking it from the top</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.piznairpeak_en-us9097547756_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.piznairpeak_en-us9097547756_uhd/</guid><description>There&amp;#39;s a mountain in Switzerland that&amp;#39;s always looking down on you—but don&amp;#39;t take it personally.

Welcome to Corona Arch, seen in today&amp;#39;s image, a towering Navajo sandstone formation that offers big adventure without the big crowds. The Corona Arch Trail starts off easy but packs a punch of scenery: railroad tracks, slickrock scrambles, and even a metal cable assist make it more than just a walk in the desert. After 1.5 miles of walking, the payoff is big: a massive arch that&amp;#39;s 140 feet wide and 105 feet high. It&amp;#39;s so large that people once swung from it on ropes, until that was banned for safety reasons. Even without the adrenaline stunts, the hike offers beautiful views and unforgettable moments in the heart of Red Rock Country.

Matriarchs, the oldest females, can recall the locations of water sources from decades past, and they use that knowledge to lead their herds through tough times. Their social bonds run just as deep.

In La Jolla, California, tide pools teach you about ocean life—right at your feet. Along the rocky shoreline of this San Diego coastal neighborhood, tide pools form during low tide as seawater gets trapped in natural depressions. These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla&amp;#39;s rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach, and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars. Over time, the tide pools are created through the process of erosion—waves hit the sandstone and limestone coastlines until they carve out pockets that hold water. Twice a day, as the tide moves in and out, these spaces flood and drain, challenging the survival skills of everything inside. Winter months, when tides are lowest during daylight hours, are ideal for observing them.</description></item><item><title>Whooo's home?</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.laplandowl_en-us8965493818_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.laplandowl_en-us8965493818_uhd/</guid><description>Silent hunters of the night sky, owls are among the most intriguing creatures in the animal kingdom.

But when a baby ring-tailed lemur wraps its tail around or gives it a tug, it&amp;#39;s actually working on crucial skills. The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly, and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom, and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination, and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings, and &amp;#39;stink fights&amp;#39; between males add to the social drama.</description></item><item><title>Friendship without borders</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.saypedubai_en-us5078679271_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.saypedubai_en-us5078679271_uhd/</guid><description>What do giant handshakes painted on the ground have to do with friendship? Quite a lot, actually. Celebrated every July 30, the International Day of Friendship reminds us that tackling global challenges, like poverty, violence, and injustice, starts with something surprisingly simple: human connection. That&amp;#39;s exactly what artist Saype had in mind with &amp;#39;Beyond Walls,&amp;#39; a series of massive, biodegradable land-art murals featuring interlinked hands. Symbolizing unity and solidarity, these works have stretched across five continents. At Expo 2020 Dubai, Saype&amp;#39;s 11th installation covered over 16,000 square feet of grass in Al Forsan Park. It formed a striking black-and-white handshake that could only be fully appreciated from above, as seen here.

At just 121 acres, it&amp;#39;s the smallest independent nation in the world, yet its reach spans centuries and continents. Home to the pope and the spiritual center of the Roman Catholic Church, this walled enclave is a blend of art, history, and devotion. At its core stands St. Peter&amp;#39;s Basilica. Seen in the distance in today&amp;#39;s image, this Renaissance masterpiece is built over what is believed to be the tomb of St. Peter, the first bishop of Rome. With its soaring dome dominating the skyline, the basilica is one of the largest churches in the world. Just beyond the basilica lies St. Peter&amp;#39;s Square, where thousands gather for papal blessings. The Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel, which houses Michelangelo&amp;#39;s famed ceiling, are other must-sees.

The national park, located in southwestern South Dakota, features a dramatic terrain of eroded buttes, pinnacles, and spires carved by millennia of wind and water. Spanning over 379 square miles, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor center and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park&amp;#39;s dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about one inch per year, revealing colorful bands of volcanic ash, silt, and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels, and saber-toothed cats.</description></item><item><title>Rainforests of the sea</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.acroporareef_en-us5567789372_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.acroporareef_en-us5567789372_uhd/</guid><description>Every third week of July, Coral Reef Awareness Week reminds us that beneath the ocean&amp;#39;s surface lies a world as rich and complex as any rainforest.

Riders compete in mountain climbs, sprints, and time trials, with the race traditionally ending in Paris.</description></item><item><title>Sparks over Seattle</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.seattlefireworks_en-us0523563675_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.seattlefireworks_en-us0523563675_uhd/</guid><description>Every year on July 4, Americans come together to celebrate the birth of our nation.

This area has served as a natural resource for humans and animals for centuries, with the Rainbow River—flowing through the park—playing a major role. The gently winding waterway is fed by Rainbow Springs, one of Florida&amp;#39;s largest springs. The water that bubbles up here comes from a 770-square-mile area and eventually flows into the Withlacoochee River.</description></item><item><title>In the bubble-tip zone</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.maroonclownfish_en-us0391262783_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.maroonclownfish_en-us0391262783_uhd/</guid><description>That bright fish hiding in the anemone? That&amp;#39;s the spine-cheeked anemonefish, or the maroon clownfish, and it is not just a cute creature. Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. It is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. Spine-cheeked anemonefish thrive in warm, shallow waters and stick close to their chosen sea anemone.</description></item><item><title>Canada turns 158</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.canadadayfogo_en-us0231478181_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.canadadayfogo_en-us0231478181_uhd/</guid><description>Today, Canada turns another year older. Canada Day is a nod to the moment when the country officially came together in 1867. What began as a confederation of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia has grown into a nation of 10 provinces and 3 territories. Originally called Dominion Day, the name was changed to Canada Day in 1982—the same year the Constitution Act was signed, granting the country full control over its constitution. While Canada Day is not the country&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Independence Day,&amp;#39; it&amp;#39;s the closest thing to it. Canadians celebrate this holiday with fireworks, parades, concerts, and community events. Ottawa, the country&amp;#39;s capital, hosts one of the biggest celebrations, featuring music and speeches on Parliament Hill.</description></item><item><title>Rock-solid defense</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.wolfecrater_en-us2390330059_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.wolfecrater_en-us2390330059_uhd/</guid><description>Each scar on Earth from a meteorite impact tells a story—from the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs to the lesser-known craters that dot the planet. Asteroid Day highlights ongoing research into asteroids and the potential threats they pose. Started in 2015 and backed by the United Nations, this day marks the anniversary of the Tunguska event—a massive explosion that occurred in Siberia on June 30, 1908. This explosion flattened over 800 square miles of Siberian forest near the Tunguska River. The blast released energy equal to 10–15 megatons of TNT, a standard measure of explosive force. Since then, craters like Arizona&amp;#39;s Barringer, Quebec&amp;#39;s Manicouagan, and others have helped scientists study what happens when space rocks hit Earth.</description></item><item><title>Where history gets spicy</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bandaisland_en-us9494080788_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bandaisland_en-us9494080788_uhd/</guid><description>Every June 29, the International Day of the Tropics shines a light on the equator-hugging zone where the sun sticks around, and climate conversations get real. The tropics span a broad region between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, including parts of Asia, Africa, Oceania, Central America, and South America. Nearly 40% of the global population lives in this band, which also hosts 80% of the world&amp;#39;s biodiversity.

Fed up with years of harassment, LGBTQIA+ patrons fought back. What followed was six days of unrest—and the start of a movement. Led in part by trans activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, the uprising challenged not only police brutality but society&amp;#39;s silence. Stonewall wasn&amp;#39;t the beginning of queer existence, but it was the moment people said &amp;#39;no more&amp;#39; loud enough to be heard worldwide. The first Pride marches came the next year, not as parties, but as protests. Thousands marched in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago to mark the anniversary of Stonewall. Holding signs and chanting for liberation, they demanded visibility, rights, and justice.</description></item><item><title>A splendid creature</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.splendidfrog_en-us9346105347_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.splendidfrog_en-us9346105347_uhd/</guid><description>Don&amp;#39;t let the name fool you—this frog isn&amp;#39;t just leafing around. The splendid leaf frog (aka splendid tree frog) is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet, and a disappearing act. One minute it&amp;#39;s a humble green leaf, the next it&amp;#39;s a flash of color mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama, and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. It spends its days snoozing on leaves and its nights foraging for insects. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy&amp;#39;s slippery heights.</description></item><item><title>Horsing around the coastline</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.horseheadrock_en-us2494437641_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.horseheadrock_en-us2494437641_uhd/</guid><description>You can lead a horse to water, but you can&amp;#39;t make it drink—unless, of course, you&amp;#39;re talking about Horse Head Rock, perched off the Sapphire Coast near Bermagui in New South Wales, Australia. This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock&amp;#39;s uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region&amp;#39;s oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers, and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide.</description></item><item><title>Tor and tunes: Glastonbury begins</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.glastonburyscenic_en-us2433998806_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.glastonburyscenic_en-us2433998806_uhd/</guid><description>As the sun rises over the hills in Somerset, Glastonbury Festival comes alive, transforming a quiet part of South West England into one of the world&amp;#39;s most famous music destinations. Since its humble beginnings in 1970, when tickets cost just one British pound, Glastonbury has grown into a cultural powerhouse, attracting over 200,000 fans each year. The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture, and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury&amp;#39;s stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year&amp;#39;s festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young, and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael&amp;#39;s Church Tower. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur&amp;#39;s Avalon to ancient spiritual lore.</description></item><item><title>Nature took its time</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.delicatearch_en-us2369284902_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.delicatearch_en-us2369284902_uhd/</guid><description>This place wasn&amp;#39;t built overnight—nature took its time to craft this masterpiece. What you see at Arches National Park, Utah, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift, and weathering. These arches were formed when salt beds were left behind by ancient seas. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted, and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognized as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971.</description></item><item><title>From ruins to resilience</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.dresdenelbe_en-us2259441179_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.dresdenelbe_en-us2259441179_uhd/</guid><description>Berlin gets the buzz, Munich brings the beer, but what about Dresden, in eastern Germany?

This year&amp;#39;s celebration takes place from June 16 to 22. It shines a spotlight on the birds, bats, bees, butterflies, beetles, and other animals that help pollinate nearly 90% of flowering plants—including many of the fruits, vegetables, and nuts we love. Featured here is the Asian swallowtail, captured on a red spider lily. Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly uses its keen color vision to find flowers, especially those from citrus families. While it is common and not currently threatened, its role as a pollinator is no less important.</description></item><item><title>Coastal quiet, untamed life</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.cumberlandoaks_en-us1850139942_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.cumberlandoaks_en-us1850139942_uhd/</guid><description>Before you hit the beach, you&amp;#39;ll hear it—the rustle of leaves in salty air, the creak of twisted trunks, the hush of an old world. Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia&amp;#39;s Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don&amp;#39;t break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature&amp;#39;s fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States.

Remarkably, he often adopts lost chicks, raising a mixed-age brood. For nearly 6 months, this bird father teaches and protects the chicks, with many staying close until maturity.

Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It&amp;#39;s not just one landscape, it&amp;#39;s three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here), and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the US–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners, and modern travelers have all left their footprints.

This complex assault, involving coordinated air, sea, and land forces, marked the beginning of the campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi control.</description></item><item><title>Recycling never looked so good</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.olivaresmural_en-us8824492734_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.olivaresmural_en-us8824492734_uhd/</guid><description>A global shoutout to the planet we all call home. On World Environment Day, the world hits pause to reflect and act for a greener future. Led by the United Nations Environment Programme, this day has been observed annually on June 5 since 1973. This year, hosted by the Republic of Korea, the event focuses on ending plastic pollution. Plastic contamination has crept into every part of the world—from oceans and forests to our own bodies in the form of microplastics. This year&amp;#39;s campaign aims to spark change at every level of society.</description></item><item><title>Crisp blues, sharp views</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.calaluna_en-us8760708047_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.calaluna_en-us8760708047_uhd/</guid><description>The island of Sardinia in Italy, with its rugged cliffs, secret beaches, and endless shades of blue, is undeniably a Mediterranean treasure.

For World Bicycle Day, today&amp;#39;s image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in the Dutch city of Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other modes of travel. Nearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% of residents can reach key places in just 10 minutes. This wasn&amp;#39;t always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues, and strong social movements, that the Netherlands started prioritizing bikes over cars. Since then, cities have embraced bike-friendly streets, dedicated lanes, and traffic lights for cyclists. And thanks to the famously flat landscape, cycling here feels as natural as walking.</description></item><item><title>Flower power</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.echinaceabutterfly_en-us8404044892_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.echinaceabutterfly_en-us8404044892_uhd/</guid><description>This year, the first week of June marks National Garden Week\u2014a time to celebrate the joy of gardening and the beauty it brings to our lives.

But are we doing enough to protect that underwater world? On June 1, we celebrate World Reef Awareness Day, a time to recognize the beauty—and fragility—of coral reef ecosystems. One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia&amp;#39;s largest island. At over 930 miles long, it&amp;#39;s one of the longest continuous barrier reefs in the world. Its vast 9,300-square-mile lagoon is home to over 2,300 fish species, endangered dugongs, green sea turtles, and migrating humpback whales.</description></item><item><title>An ancient glacial landscape</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.swedenreserve_en-us8234763267_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.swedenreserve_en-us8234763267_uhd/</guid><description>Discover Knuth\xf6jdsmossen, a nature reserve that covers almost 250 acres near the city of H\xe4llefors, Sweden.

The steady ripple, the splash of trout, the distant laughter of hikers. That&amp;#39;s the Little Pigeon River, threading its way through Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. Long before tourists tubed it and fly fishers angled in it, this river was how people stayed afloat. The Cherokee tribe fished in it. Settlers built grist mills along it. Towns like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge grew up next to it. Even the river&amp;#39;s name is a nod to the past—the passenger pigeon, once common in the area, vanished by the early 1900s.</description></item><item><title>Flowing through the centuries</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.miravetspain_en-us4967052818_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.miravetspain_en-us4967052818_uhd/</guid><description>Some towns live in the present.

A castle keeps its perch, potters spin like it&amp;#39;s the 1300s, and the local ferry still refuses to join the motor age. Welcome to the village where even the river seems too relaxed to rush. As Spain&amp;#39;s longest river, the Ebro winds through tales of Iberians, Romans, Moors, and Knights Templar. Locals once relied on its waters for trade, transport, and even defense. Today, you&amp;#39;ll spot kayakers, ferry boats, and visitors drifting through the same currents where Crusaders once crossed.</description></item><item><title>Otterly important</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.kelpotter_en-us4867923884_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.kelpotter_en-us4867923884_uhd/</guid><description>They slip through the water like furry torpedoes, roll on riverbanks like children on a playground, and hold hands while they nap.

Enter Mona Vale Rockpool in Sydney, Australia—a watery paradox where the ocean is wild beyond the walls and well-behaved within its calm, contained edges. Perched in Sydney&amp;#39;s Northern Beaches area—this rock pool feels more like a natural wonder than a human-made one. Built in the 1930s during the Depression, it was carved out of a natural rock shelf as part of an unemployment relief scheme. Upgraded over time, the pool is nearly 100 feet long and flanked by a smaller children&amp;#39;s pool. The pools are free, open year-round, and cleaned regularly by both council crews and the ocean itself. So next time you are in Sydney, make a splash where the waves meet the wall.

His wife, Jennie, saw potential in the depleted pit and began planting flowers in 1904.

World Donkey Day, established by Dr. Abdul Raziq Kakar, a livestock expert from Pakistan, is all about celebrating these hardworking animals. Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that&amp;#39;s just a misunderstanding. They&amp;#39;re actually cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they&amp;#39;re still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can&amp;#39;t go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges.

Built in the 13th century, this castle in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, was once a stronghold of the MacDonnells of Antrim, a branch of the Clan MacDonnell that played a key role in Irish politics from the 15th to the 17th century. The family&amp;#39;s fortunes declined after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and with little money for upkeep, the castle gradually fell into ruin.</description></item><item><title>Not your average desert trip</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.flyovernamibia_en-us6033011196_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.flyovernamibia_en-us6033011196_uhd/</guid><description>Imagine soaring through the skies in an ultralight aircraft, the wind rushing past as you take in the picturesque views.

While it is only celebrated sporadically in Mexico, it has become a vibrant celebration of Mexican culture and heritage in the US, especially in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. This holiday is often mistaken for Mexican Independence Day, but that falls on September 16. Instead, Cinco de Mayo honors Mexico&amp;#39;s fight against foreign rule and symbolizes resilience and unity. The battle itself was brief, lasting from daybreak to early evening, but the Mexican army, led by General Ignacio Zaragoza, managed to defeat a much larger and better-equipped French force. Today, Cinco de Mayo festivities feature parades, mariachi music, folk dancing, and delicious foods like tacos and mole poblano. Whether you&amp;#39;re joining a festival or just enjoying a plate of Mexican cuisine, it&amp;#39;s a great day to appreciate Mexico&amp;#39;s rich history and traditions.

The film series consists of nine movies, collectively referred to as the &amp;#39;Skywalker Saga.&amp;#39; One of the memorable filming locations is Plaza de España in Seville, Spain, as seen in today&amp;#39;s image. This beautiful square, with its semi-elliptical shape and stunning architecture, was used as the city of Theed on the planet Naboo. The scene where Senator Amidala arrives in Naboo, featuring Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, was filmed here. Plaza de España&amp;#39;s unique design, with its central building, towers, and fountain, adds a touch of magic to the Star Wars universe. This historic square, designed by Aníbal González, was originally built for the Ibero-American Exposition in 1929.</description></item><item><title>Let's celebrate the cosmos</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.archesgalaxy_en-us5690613383_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.archesgalaxy_en-us5690613383_uhd/</guid><description>Ever wondered what Saturn&amp;#39;s rings look like through a telescope?

On May 1, Hawaii celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honors culture, craftsmanship, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as &amp;#39;the coordination of mind and heart within each person.&amp;#39; Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves, or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii&amp;#39;s iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, &amp;#39;May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,&amp;#39; and the tradition quickly took root.</description></item><item><title>All that jazz and more</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.coltraneband_en-us3561448385_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.coltraneband_en-us3561448385_uhd/</guid><description>It&amp;#39;s time to jazz up—literally. From the smoky clubs of New Orleans to the bustling streets of Tokyo, jazz has crossed borders, blended cultures, and turned improvisation into an art form. Every April 30, International Jazz Day—established by UNESCO in 2011—celebrates this genre&amp;#39;s role in promoting peace, dialogue, and unity. This music form emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, a city alive with musical traditions from Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean. Rooted in blues and ragtime, jazz quickly evolved, with pioneers like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald giving it a voice. What started as an American sound soon found a global audience. Swing and bebop took over dance halls, Latin jazz brought a new rhythm, and cool jazz mellowed the mood.</description></item><item><title>Geometry in bloom</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.gardensvillandry_en-us3529015856_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.gardensvillandry_en-us3529015856_uhd/</guid><description>The grass truly is greener on the other side\u2014especially when that side is Ch\xe2teau de Villandry. While the Loire Valley in France is packed with stunning ch\xe2teaux (French for castles), Villandry stands apart, not for its towering turrets or medieval might, but for its gardens. Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat, and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays.</description></item><item><title>Pause and pose</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.orangeimpala_en-us3494359572_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.orangeimpala_en-us3494359572_uhd/</guid><description>Here&amp;#39;s a place where the wild rules and nature moves at its own pace.

The Halema&amp;#39;uma&amp;#39;u Crater is an intermittent lava lake in Kīlauea, one of Earth&amp;#39;s most active volcanoes. Since it was first documented in 1823, volcanic activity has caused the crater to fill with lava, partially collapse, erupt in fountains of lava, expand to twice its size on two occasions, and at times fill with groundwater. All this activity demonstrates the unpredictable raw power that lies below the surface of the Earth. The natural and cultural importance of this site led to the establishment of Hawai&amp;#39;i Volcanoes National Park in 1916, and to it being named a UNESCO International Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site in the 1980s.</description></item><item><title>Park it here</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.redwoodgrove_en-us3412092024_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.redwoodgrove_en-us3412092024_uhd/</guid><description>Step into a world where trees touch the sky.

Throughout the 20th century, the park&amp;#39;s glaciers have receded, uncovering new land for plant and animal life to take root. From ancient Sitka spruces to delicate fireweed shoots and moss carpeting the forest floor, plant life in Kenai Fjords flourishes. The park is also home to diverse terrestrial and marine mammals, including timber wolves, porcupines, Canadian lynxes, and cetaceans like orcas and fin whales.

This is the experience that International Dark Sky Week aims to bring back. Every April, during the week of the new moon (this year from April 21 to 27), we are invited to turn off our lights and gaze at the stars. The event was initiated by Jennifer Barlow, a high school student in 2003, to combat light pollution. One of the best places to experience the night sky&amp;#39;s beauty is Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, an International Dark Sky Park. Here, the absence of artificial light allows visitors to see the stars as our ancestors once did. Did you know that light pollution prevents us from seeing most of the stars in the Milky Way?

The Andean and Guianan cock-of-the-rock are renowned for their theatrical courtship dances, making them true head-turners of the feathered kingdom. Females are far less flashy, with brownish feathers that help them stay hidden. During the mating season, males gather in leks—noisy display arenas—where they hop, squawk, and shake their heads in an effort to impress a female.

These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they&amp;#39;ve evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there. With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a dime—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 7 pounds. Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down 10 humans. And if you think all frogs are swamp-dwellers, meet the desert rain frog, a round little amphibian that survives in dry conditions by absorbing moisture through its skin.</description></item><item><title>Apulia's White City</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.italyostuni_en-us2964422003_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.italyostuni_en-us2964422003_uhd/</guid><description>Perched on a hilltop overlooking the Adriatic Sea, there is a historic city that enchants visitors with its labyrinth of whitewashed buildings, winding alleyways, and a sun-drenched piazza.

These extremely arid regions receive less than 2.75 inches of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet, and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient herbivores migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes 43 miles in a single night, to find their favorite myrrh bushes.</description></item><item><title>You can't silence thunder</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.nebraskastorm_en-us1163295363_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.nebraskastorm_en-us1163295363_uhd/</guid><description>Today, we celebrate World Meteorological Day, commemorating the founding of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1950.

But when it hunts, this jet-black African species showcases an extraordinary skill—it takes the shape of an umbrella, as seen in today&amp;#39;s image.</description></item><item><title>A vortex state of mind</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.sedonaspring_en-us9611080272_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.sedonaspring_en-us9611080272_uhd/</guid><description>Sedona, Arizona, is a place where nature, history, and spirituality converge amidst stunning red rock formations.

The term &amp;#39;Ides&amp;#39; referred to the midpoint of the month in the Roman calendar, often marking the full moon. It was a time of celebration, with festivals and public gatherings. However, in 44 BCE, the Ides of March became synonymous with political upheaval, betrayal, and an event that would trigger the fall of the Roman Republic. On that fateful day, Julius Caesar, Rome&amp;#39;s powerful dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators. The conspirators, including his close ally Brutus, believed they were saving the Republic from Caesar&amp;#39;s growing authority. Caesar was attacked near the Theater of Pompey, but the tension of that moment echoed through the Roman Forum—the beating heart of Rome&amp;#39;s political and social life.</description></item><item><title>Pi in the sky</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.basquedolmen_en-us9089569057_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.basquedolmen_en-us9089569057_uhd/</guid><description>Calculating the ratio of a circle&amp;#39;s circumference to its diameter is as easy as pi.

This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts, and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact.</description></item><item><title>When the ocean breaks the rules</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.nusapenida_en-us8722184767_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.nusapenida_en-us8722184767_uhd/</guid><description>Let&amp;#39;s be real—the beaches in Bali are beautiful, but the ones in Nusa Penida?

You&amp;#39;re not alone—losing an hour to daylight saving time can leave anyone groggy. That&amp;#39;s why Napping Day exists. Introduced in 1999 by William Anthony, a Boston University professor, and his wife, Camille, this unofficial holiday encourages everyone to take quality naps. Observed on the Monday after clocks spring forward, it&amp;#39;s a reminder that rest is essential for well-being. Research backs it up—short naps boost mood, enhance concentration, and sharpen memory. Napping is also linked to lower stress and better heart health. While power naps (20-30 minutes) are ideal for a quick recharge, even a few minutes of shut-eye can help.</description></item><item><title>The March of time</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.italyclock_en-us7397391355_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.italyclock_en-us7397391355_uhd/</guid><description>It&amp;#39;s the time of year again when clocks spring forward, stealing an hour of sleep but giving us longer evenings to enjoy. Daylight saving time (DST) starts today at 2 AM, except in Arizona and Hawaii, reminding us that time, quite literally, waits for no one. The idea is simple: maximizing daylight and reducing energy consumption by syncing our activities with the natural light cycle. This concept was popularized by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, though his suggestion to &amp;#39;save candles&amp;#39; was more satirical than a serious proposal. Fast-forward to the early 20th century, when many countries adopted DST to conserve fuel during wartime. The US officially standardized it in 1966 with the Uniform Time Act. Today, DST runs from March to November in around 70 countries, giving eight months of extended evening light.</description></item><item><title>Making her-story!</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.fearlesswomen_en-us7338738180_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.fearlesswomen_en-us7338738180_uhd/</guid><description>Happy International Women&amp;#39;s Day, everyone!

Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 30 pounds. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, they hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 20 miles per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, the desert bighorn sheep sub-species can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive.</description></item><item><title>A jungle adventure</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.suratthani_en-us3326265231_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.suratthani_en-us3326265231_uhd/</guid><description>Today we&amp;#39;re in a wildlife-packed wonderland with rainforests older than the Amazon—Khao Sok National Park in Surat Thani province, southern Thailand.

The state of Victoria&amp;#39;s largest salt lake was formed around 120,000 years ago. Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it&amp;#39;s covered in about 2 inches of water. The name &amp;#39;Tyrrell&amp;#39; comes from the local Wergaia word for &amp;#39;sky,&amp;#39; a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People&amp;#39;s interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 70 square miles, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including kangaroos, emus, and various reptiles.</description></item><item><title>Darwin's blueprint</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.galapagosiguana_en-us6976814194_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.galapagosiguana_en-us6976814194_uhd/</guid><description>Today, we celebrate Darwin Day—a shout-out to Charles Darwin and his game-changing ideas about life on Earth.

The highlight is the massive Buddha in Cave 5, which is a jaw-dropping 56 feet tall. But don&amp;#39;t stop there—each cave offers something unique. Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musicians, and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule.

Over 4,000 years ago, in ancient Egypt, Assyria, and China, these foldable canopies were first used to shield people from the sun. It wasn&amp;#39;t until the 17th century that the umbrella, as we know it today, gained popularity in Europe, initially as a luxury item primarily for women. Fast-forward a few centuries, and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too.

Perched 4,921 feet up in the Caucasus Mountains, Mestia is a charming highland town in northwest Georgia. The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today&amp;#39;s image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia&amp;#39;s Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region&amp;#39;s history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn&amp;#39;t just a town; it&amp;#39;s a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains.</description></item><item><title>Stuck in a blue moment</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bluenorway_en-us6457602567_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bluenorway_en-us6457602567_uhd/</guid><description>In Norway, winter isn&amp;#39;t just a season—it&amp;#39;s an experience. In the north of the country, nights stretch for 20 hours, and there are entire weeks when the sun remains hidden below the horizon. It might sound bleak, but it&amp;#39;s a unique time of the year. Why? Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky.</description></item><item><title>Reflections of a nation's legacy</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.whararikibeach_en-us3505877495_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.whararikibeach_en-us3505877495_uhd/</guid><description>What do you get when you bring together more than 500 M\u0101ori chiefs, representatives of the British Crown, and a treaty signed in 1840?

Today, Americans and Canadians rely on the prognostication skills of Punxsutawney Phil to determine if winter will hang on. Phil is a famous groundhog, also known as a woodchuck, and legend has it that if he emerges from his burrow February 2 and sees his own shadow, he&amp;#39;ll go back to sleep for another six weeks of winter. If he doesn&amp;#39;t, it will be an early spring. German immigrants brought the custom to America, where it was first celebrated in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, in 1887. Historically, Europeans celebrated February 2 as the first day of spring, and Germans originally watched badgers and other small animals for signs of seasonal change important to farmers. The Germans who settled in Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries chose the area&amp;#39;s native groundhog for this task.</description></item><item><title>Roots of freedom</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.africanmuseumdc_en-us9749048351_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.africanmuseumdc_en-us9749048351_uhd/</guid><description>Today, the United States begins an annual, monthlong celebration of African Americans and their contributions to the country&amp;#39;s history and culture. The forerunner of Black History Month was created in 1926 by historian Carter Woodson and minister Jesse Moorland to study and promote the legacy of Black Americans. The weeklong celebration was observed in the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and African American abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Its popularity grew over the next 50 years in large part because of the civil rights movement, and President Gerald Ford expanded it to a full month in 1976.

First discovered by local fishermen in the 18th century, the grotto was named after the Roman god of the sea. The entire cave complex stretches on for around 2.5 miles, although visitors can only access about 1,000 feet of the total. Inside, there&amp;#39;s a labyrinth of lit pathways winding past stalactite and stalagmite formations, leading to a 390-foot-long saltwater lake.</description></item><item><title>1,001 New Mexican dunes</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.whitesandsnp_en-us0745183236_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.whitesandsnp_en-us0745183236_uhd/</guid><description>Today&amp;#39;s image features the dazzling beauty of White Sands National Park, New Mexico—a surreal expanse of glistening white gypsum dunes, the largest of its kind on Earth.

President Theodore Roosevelt designated the area as a national monument in 1908, and Pinnacles would earn its status as a national park in 2013. As we celebrate the park&amp;#39;s anniversary today, let&amp;#39;s take a moment to appreciate this landscape. Pinnacles owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs, and talus caves, which are created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace.

For the first time, a national museum flung its doors wide open, offering free access to knowledge and culture for all. The story begins with Sir Hans Sloane, an Anglo-Irish physician and avid collector. His collection of more than 71,000 items, ranging from books and manuscripts to botanical samples and antiquities, formed the museum&amp;#39;s foundation. Fast-forward nearly 266 years, and the museum houses more than 8 million objects, the largest collection of artifacts in the world, although only about 1% of the collection is currently on display. Its treasures span continents and millennia, from the Rosetta Stone—key to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs—to the Parthenon Marbles, the Benin Bronzes, and samurai armor.</description></item><item><title>Calmness overload</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.cadizspain_en-us9699586606_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.cadizspain_en-us9699586606_uhd/</guid><description>Zahara de la Sierra, a stunning whitewashed village in the hills of Cádiz province in Spain, offers a blend of history and nature in the south of the Iberian Peninsula.

Celebrated on December 23, Festivus was popularized by the TV show &amp;#39;Seinfeld,&amp;#39; although it was actually invented by the family of one of the series&amp;#39; writers. The celebration centers around the unadorned aluminum Festivus pole. After dinner, the traditional Festivus &amp;#39;airing of grievances&amp;#39; gets underway. This consists of telling friends and family the ways they&amp;#39;ve disappointed you over the year. This can provide some much-needed catharsis at what can be a stressful time of year. The day traditionally concludes with feats of strength. Once the head of the household has been pinned, Festivus is officially over. Those who embrace this farcical holiday welcome the opportunity to let off some steam amid the Christmas build-up chaos—much like these red-crowned cranes in Hokkaido, Japan.</description></item><item><title>Surf, sand, and Santa</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.crystalpier_en-us0086755810_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.crystalpier_en-us0086755810_uhd/</guid><description>Santa has plenty of runway to land, but good luck trying to find a chimney.

Today marks the shortest day in the Northern Hemisphere, while last night was the longest night of the year. This has been an important event for millennia, with evidence of celebrations going back as far as 10,000 BCE. Some of the world&amp;#39;s most famous Stone Age monuments, including Stonehenge, are aligned with the point that the sun rises or sets on the winter solstice. Traditionally, it was a time for feasting and lighting of fires to symbolize the darkest day of the year. Ancient Germanic tribes celebrated the winter solstice by bringing evergreens into their homes as a symbol of the returning light and the coming spring.</description></item><item><title>He's coming to town...</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.santaclausvillage_en-us9527661842_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.santaclausvillage_en-us9527661842_uhd/</guid><description>Nestled in Rovaniemi, Finland, and pictured in today&amp;#39;s image, Santa Claus Village is a magical year-round destination where visitors can step into the enchanting world of Christmas.

One of the prettiest places in the Lofoten Islands of Norway, Reine is a fishing village with a population of around 300. A trading post since 1775, it has evolved from a commercial hub to become a sought-after tourist destination. The village&amp;#39;s waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen&amp;#39;s cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in color, as seen in today&amp;#39;s image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbor framed by the towering mountain range.

Well, legend has it that Lake Misurina, pictured here, in Italy&amp;#39;s Dolomites, was born from the sorrow of a giant named Sorapis. At more than 5,700 feet above sea level, it is the largest natural lake in the Cadore region, with its perimeter stretching more than 1.5 miles. The area around the lake is known for its beneficial climate, especially for those with respiratory conditions. Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors. The lake played a role in the 1956 Winter Olympics, where it hosted speed skating events on natural ice, and it has even been immortalized in a pop song by singer Claudio Baglioni. With astounding views, mythical roots, and activities for every season, this lake may well be the Dolomites&amp;#39; most alluring reflection.</description></item><item><title>'Hoo' said that?</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.northernhawkowl_en-us7592435350_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.northernhawkowl_en-us7592435350_uhd/</guid><description>For 125 years, bird enthusiasts across North America have turned the holiday season into a festive, feathered affair with the Christmas Bird Count. Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world&amp;#39;s longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called &amp;#39;circles.&amp;#39; Each circle has a 15-mile diameter, and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season.

At up to 6 feet tall and weighing up to 400 pounds, they were used primarily as pack animals for about 6,500 years. They were also bred as a source of food, hides, tallow for candles, dung for fuel, and fabric. While inferior to alpaca and guanaco wool, llama fleece is soft, warm, durable, and fairly lightweight.

Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: &amp;#39;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&amp;#39; by Victor Hugo, published in 1831.

While these towers can be found in many places, today&amp;#39;s image shows some at Mono Lake in Mono County, California. These structures develop when calcium-rich fresh water, flowing into the lake from several creeks and streams, mixes with the lake&amp;#39;s alkaline water. Over centuries, this interaction caused calcium carbonate to build up, forming tufa spires above the lake&amp;#39;s surface. To preserve the tufa towers, the Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve was established in 1981.</description></item><item><title>On the front line of extinction</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.rhinoskenya_en-us7514650014_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.rhinoskenya_en-us7514650014_uhd/</guid><description>It&amp;#39;s Wildlife Conservation Day—an important reminder to celebrate and defend our planet&amp;#39;s incredible biodiversity.

From there, they were introduced to the Greek islands and mainland by the Phoenicians, then farther afield, reaching Spain and the western edge of the Mediterranean by around 1000 BCE. The olive branch has been a symbol of peace since ancient times, and olive trees have been grown for their oil, wood, and fruit for millennia.</description></item><item><title>Life in the wild</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.amboseligiraffes_en-us9072366924_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.amboseligiraffes_en-us9072366924_uhd/</guid><description>Masai giraffes roam the vast landscapes of Amboseli National Park in Kenya, as seen in today&amp;#39;s image. At 18 feet or more, giraffes are the world&amp;#39;s tallest land mammals. Along with prehensile tongues that are more than a foot and a half long, they use their impressive height to eat foliage found almost 20 feet from the ground. They&amp;#39;re also faster than you might think, being able to sprint over short distances up to 37 mph. Giraffes are common in East Africa and can be seen grazing in grasslands, woodlands, and reserves.</description></item><item><title>Tides and twilight</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.sonomacoast_en-us5218026576_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.sonomacoast_en-us5218026576_uhd/</guid><description>Sonoma Coast State Park offers a picturesque retreat with its sandy beaches, natural arches, and secluded coves.

Welcome to Tasman National Park in Tasmania, an island state of Australia about 150 miles off its southeastern coast. Spanning more than 41 square miles, this park features dramatic cliffs and distinctive columns of dolerite rock. Tasmans Arch, seen in today&amp;#39;s image, is a standout example. Shaped over time by the Tasman Sea, it was once the roof of a massive sea cave. The sea&amp;#39;s pressure, combined with air, sand, and stones, slowly pried open the vertical cracks in the cliff, dislodging chunks of rock. The cave kept growing, deepening, and lengthening, until it eventually gave way, leaving behind this towering natural bridge. Tasmans Arch is named after the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who also lends his name to the state of Tasmania.</description></item><item><title>Guiding the way since 1860</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.porthcawllighthouse_en-us4147042402_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.porthcawllighthouse_en-us4147042402_uhd/</guid><description>With waves crashing against its sturdy base and a stormy sea swirling around, this lighthouse in Porthcawl, on the south coast of Wales, has been standing resilient since 1860. At 30 feet tall, Porthcawl Lighthouse, designed by the eminent engineer James Walker, is often pictured being battered by waves when storms hit. The town&amp;#39;s rugged coastline, with its hidden rocky coves, has always posed a perilous challenge to sailors. Porthcawl Lighthouse was built to help guide the increasing maritime traffic along the Bristol Channel. This cast-iron lighthouse was the last one in the UK to be powered by coal and gas.

Welcome to Arches National Park, Utah. The story of this otherworldly landscape starts 65 million years ago when a dry seabed stood here. Over time, geological forces warped and squeezed the land, twisting the sandstone into lumps and bumps. Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins, and balanced rocks that now stand in this area. The park has more than 2,000 natural stone arches, the highest concentration of these structures anywhere on Earth. In today&amp;#39;s image, we can see two of them: Double Arch, as seen through Cove Arch. The larger arch of Double Arch spans 144 feet and is 112 feet tall, the tallest and second-longest of the park&amp;#39;s arches.</description></item><item><title>Heroes among us</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.veteranreflections_en-us4567357121_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.veteranreflections_en-us4567357121_uhd/</guid><description>Freedom is not free, and nobody understands that better than veterans. Today, America honors its military men and women for their service. The holiday originally celebrated a temporary halt in fighting between Allied nations and Germany during World War I—the official end of the war came the following year in 1919. Armistice Day, as it was later named, commemorated this respite, and it became a federal holiday in 1938. A few years later, America fought in World War II, and later, the Korean War. As a result, Congress amended the holiday in 1954, exchanging the word &amp;#39;Armistice&amp;#39; with &amp;#39;Veterans&amp;#39; to include veterans of all the country&amp;#39;s wars.</description></item><item><title>Flamboyance in flight</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.yucatanflamingos_en-us4470232432_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.yucatanflamingos_en-us4470232432_uhd/</guid><description>Ever seen a group of flamingos take to the skies? If you have, there&amp;#39;s a good chance they were Caribbean flamingos, also known as American flamingos, as seen in Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, in today&amp;#39;s image. Flamingos are referred to as a flamboyance when in a group, but they can also be called a stand, colony, or pat. The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries, and along coastlines. Because of their pink color, they&amp;#39;re often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork.</description></item><item><title>Cosmic views over earthly hues</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.moroccomilkyway_en-us4411505209_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.moroccomilkyway_en-us4411505209_uhd/</guid><description>Get ready for a starry Moroccan night!

The rivers seen in today&amp;#39;s image are formed from the meltwater of vast glaciers like Vatnajökull, Langjökull, and Hofsjökull. Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 3,000 square miles—approximately 10% of the country&amp;#39;s landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, interwoven across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water also powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland&amp;#39;s status as a leader in sustainable energy.</description></item><item><title>Wolves in the wild</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.canadawolves_en-us4285635290_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.canadawolves_en-us4285635290_uhd/</guid><description>Amidst the mist-covered cedars and Sitka spruces of Canada&amp;#39;s Great Bear Rainforest, the Vancouver Coastal Sea wolf roams free. These canines thrive in this ecosystem in British Columbia, which stretches from the north of Vancouver Island to the Alaskan border. This unique subspecies of the gray wolf is specific to the region and leads a semi-aquatic lifestyle, swimming between islands in search of food. Unlike other wolf species, they have a marine-based diet, consisting of fish, clams, mussels, crabs, otters, and seals. These animals live in packs, communicating with each other through growls, barks, and whines, so they&amp;#39;re often heard before they are seen.</description></item><item><title>Shades of sunset</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.shishibeach_en-us4231457607_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.shishibeach_en-us4231457607_uhd/</guid><description>Olympic National Park, established in 1938, offers an escape into unspoiled wilderness.

These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing, and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers, and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, featured in today&amp;#39;s image. Today, on National Bison Day, observed every first Saturday in November, we honor these noble creatures—a testament to the American spirit and the monumental conservation efforts to save them.</description></item><item><title>Celebrating America's Native heritage</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.hovenweepruins_en-us3883549583_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.hovenweepruins_en-us3883549583_uhd/</guid><description>Today marks the start of Native American Heritage Month.

But what really sets it apart, is its reputation as one of Scotland&amp;#39;s most haunted spots.</description></item><item><title>Hoots and haunts</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.greatowl_en-us3778222109_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.greatowl_en-us3778222109_uhd/</guid><description>The Halloween season is upon us, so let&amp;#39;s meet one of the holiday&amp;#39;s icons: the great horned owl. With its keen vision, eerie vocalizations, and silent flight, this owl has historically been revered and feared. In folklore and mythology, owls were considered symbols of wisdom and omens of death. On Samhain, the Celtic precursor to Halloween, the owl was believed to be the kin of roaming spirits.</description></item><item><title>It's carving time</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.pumpkinmist_en-us3686565863_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.pumpkinmist_en-us3686565863_uhd/</guid><description>As fall covers the landscape with amber hues and the chill of Halloween approaches, it&amp;#39;s time to start carving some spooky jack-o&amp;#39;-lanterns. Originally from Ireland and Scotland, this craft was brought to America by immigrants who initially made lanterns from turnips and potatoes but later found pumpkins more plentiful and easier to carve. Once hollowed out and lit with candles, the gourds were transformed into flickering defenses against evil spirits.</description></item><item><title>A mother's warmth in the cold</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.polarbearhug_en-us3461212514_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.polarbearhug_en-us3461212514_uhd/</guid><description>Polar Bear Week champions the Arctic&amp;#39;s majestic predator, one of nature&amp;#39;s greatest hunters.

This spine-tingling forest covers about 445 acres, with its gnarled beech, hornbeam, ash, and oak trees twisting toward the sky. The salty sea air, wind, and the moist climate helped mold the trees&amp;#39; distorted shapes, which look particularly haunting at night. Visitors to this forest in the Mecklenburg-West Pomerania region, can brave the trails alone or sign up for a storytelling session where actors dressed as ghosts bring local legends and folktales to life.

The towering presence of Mont Blanc has left an indelible mark on literature, most notably on Mary Shelley&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Frankenstein.&amp;#39; The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honoring Shelley&amp;#39;s literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. &amp;#39;Frankenstein&amp;#39; was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori, and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. Forced inside by incessant rain, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror.</description></item><item><title>Ghosts of the gold rush</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bodiecalifornia_en-us3185568116_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bodiecalifornia_en-us3185568116_uhd/</guid><description>In the ghostly silence of Bodie, California, it feels like time stands still. This mining camp became a booming gold rush town in the 1870s, after a cave-in revealed a rich vein of gold. Bodie was named after W.S. Bodey, a prospector who died in a blizzard before seeing the town&amp;#39;s rise. When large deposits were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls, and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town&amp;#39;s fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled, and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie&amp;#39;s streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay.</description></item><item><title>Stairway to nowhere</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.madamesherricastle_en-us3066456106_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.madamesherricastle_en-us3066456106_uhd/</guid><description>Madame Sherri Forest in Chesterfield, New Hampshire, is a captivating destination steeped in history and natural beauty. It was once the site of an extravagant house built in the 1930s by Madame Antoinette Sherri, a flamboyant 1920s costume designer known for her lavish parties. Madame Sherri&amp;#39;s dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her &amp;#39;castle&amp;#39; fell into disrepair and was vandalized. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase, and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney.</description></item><item><title>Fearsome fa\xe7ade</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.monsterdoor_en-us2973387472_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.monsterdoor_en-us2973387472_uhd/</guid><description>At the top of the Spanish Steps in Rome, take a left underneath the imposing Catholic church. Down an unassuming side street, there&amp;#39;s a surprise waiting for you: a house of monsters. Welcome to the Palazzo Zuccari, a 16th-century palace where myths seem to come to life on its façade—grotesque faces swallow up its doors and windows. Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgment in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante&amp;#39;s Inferno are replete with mythical beings. The monster door originally led to the palazzo&amp;#39;s garden because Zuccari enjoyed making his guests experience the contrast between the scary entrance and the beautiful serenity of the garden. These days, the door leads to the Bibliotheca Hertziana, a library specializing in Italian art history, from the Middle Ages to the modern day, which has occupied the site of the garden since 1912.</description></item><item><title>Standing tall in fall</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.autumncypress_en-us2771131028_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.autumncypress_en-us2771131028_uhd/</guid><description>The sturdy, swamp-loving, cypress trees pictured in the mist on our homepage can grow over 100 feet tall. These towering specimens are found in George L. Smith State Park, which spans 1,634 acres in Emanuel County, Georgia. The park&amp;#39;s centerpiece is a 412-acre mill pond, a favorite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the southeastern US. Winding through the park are over 7 miles of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises.

Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the small and shy mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the &amp;#39;fake eyes&amp;#39; or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia, and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown color but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don&amp;#39;t need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells, or man-made objects like bottles and cans.</description></item><item><title>Celebrating architecture</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.elbephilharmonic_en-us8658450086_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.elbephilharmonic_en-us8658450086_uhd/</guid><description>Build your excitement—it&amp;#39;s World Architecture Day!

Welcome to Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Our homepage stars were photographed in the waters off Spitsbergen, the largest of the archipelago&amp;#39;s nine islands, where male and female herds are found year-round. Male walruses can reach almost 12 feet long and weigh more than 2,600 pounds. During mating season, they use this girth to fight among themselves for dominance over groups of females, called harems.</description></item><item><title>Connecting Connecticut</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.connecticutbridge_en-us4557226937_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.connecticutbridge_en-us4557226937_uhd/</guid><description>Covered bridges like West Cornwall Covered Bridge, pictured in today&amp;#39;s image, were designed with roofs and siding to protect their wooden structures from weathering, greatly increasing their durability.

Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. They&amp;#39;re expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food and using rocks to crack open shellfish, one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 sea otters in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for their dense fur for almost two centuries. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 sea otters were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban and conservation efforts have helped them rebound in their historic habitat to an estimated 125,000. Despite this success, some populations continue to struggle, and sea otters are still an endangered species. So, unlike our homepage star, we can&amp;#39;t relax on sea otter conservation just yet.</description></item><item><title>Fall into reflection</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.autumncumbria_en-us3797009731_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.autumncumbria_en-us3797009731_uhd/</guid><description>Fall is in the air—officially.

Its origins are rooted in late 1800s efforts to recognize the contributions the country&amp;#39;s workers, and labor activists ultimately helped establish the 40-hour work week and weekends. President Grover Cleveland made the US holiday official in 1894. Today, many Americans celebrate the long weekend, which is often considered the unofficial end of summer, by grilling, hanging out with friends and family, and going to parades.</description></item><item><title>Row your boat gently down the Thames</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.thameslondon_en-us9385705885_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.thameslondon_en-us9385705885_uhd/</guid><description>Welcome to the Totally Thames Festival in London, England.

These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 20 feet and weighing as much as 1,000 pounds. Their dark color helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes, and seasonally flooded savannas. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles, and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping the populations of their prey under control. More caimans mean fewer piranhas, which attack cattle, and fewer capybaras, which can cause crop damage.</description></item><item><title>Idyllic island escape</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.palmyraatoll_en-us8399787979_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.palmyraatoll_en-us8399787979_uhd/</guid><description>Welcome to this eco-travelers&amp;#39; paradise in the middle of the Pacific.

Kaptai Lake in Rangamati District is home to the floating market of seasonal fruit seen in today&amp;#39;s image. The lake was created in the early 1960s to generate hydropower, submerging not just land and the palace of the king of the Chakmas, Bangladesh&amp;#39;s largest ethnic minority group, but a way of life, displacing 100,000 people. Sixty years on and the landscape has changed. This buoyant bazaar has become a livelihood, as farmers navigate their wooden vessels along the bank to engage with eager buyers.

Sunset Point, seen in today&amp;#39;s image, offers sweeping views of the hoodoos of Utah&amp;#39;s Bryce Canyon National Park. These rock formations are created by frost weathering and stream erosion, which shape the stone into an otherworldly landscape. Perched at 8,000 to 9,000 feet, this overlook offers a panoramic view of rocky spires in red, orange, and white. The most iconic of them is Thor&amp;#39;s Hammer, a hoodoo that overlooks a part of the park known as the &amp;#39;Silent City.&amp;#39; The Queen&amp;#39;s Garden Trail, which leads from Sunset Point to Sunrise Point, offers even more vistas and rock formations, including the Queen Victoria hoodoo. According to the legend told by the Paiute Indigenous people who inhabited this area, hoodoos are people who have been turned to stone for their misdeeds by the trickster Coyote. Whether you&amp;#39;re a hiker, a photographer, or simply a traveler, the hoodoos are waiting.</description></item><item><title>A medieval Manhattan</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.gimignanotuscany_en-us6339668180_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.gimignanotuscany_en-us6339668180_uhd/</guid><description>These medieval towers stand tall over San Gimignano, a small town near Siena in north central Italy. In the Middle Ages, a town grew up around a church dedicated to St. Geminianus (San Gimignano in Italian). As well as being a popular stop for pilgrims on their way to Rome, the town prospered thanks to its trade in local Vernaccia wine and in saffron, which is grown in the nearby hills. However, when the Black Death struck in 1348, half the population was lost, slowing the town&amp;#39;s development and preserving its medieval character to this day.</description></item><item><title>Roar and explore</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.corbetttigers_en-us6183924498_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.corbetttigers_en-us6183924498_uhd/</guid><description>We&amp;#39;re off to a roaring start today: It&amp;#39;s International Tiger Day, which aims to protect these magnificent big cats amid threats such as poaching and habitat loss.

Miles of hiking trails wind through the dense woodlands, leading adventurers to cascading waterfalls and scenic overlooks. The park also boasts some of the highest mountains in the eastern United States, including Clingmans Dome, which rises to 6,643 feet. Visitors are often enchanted by the mist that blankets the peaks each morning, giving the park its mystical name.

Most of the Spanish island of Lanzarote is treeless and covered with black-gray soil. This thick blanket of volcanic gravel is the result of a series of eruptions in the 1700s. By 1775, farmers started growing crops in the new layer of nutrient-rich soil. Volcanic soil absorbs and retains moisture, and the ash keeps its temperature favorable for growing grapes. The holes surrounded by stones you see in our image were dug to protect young grape plants from strong winds. La Geria&amp;#39;s innovative approach to cultivation in an arid climate has been rewarded with its abundance of fine wine, fermented from Malvasia grapes.</description></item><item><title>Türkiye's stony spires</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.cappadociarocks_en-us8162611189_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.cappadociarocks_en-us8162611189_uhd/</guid><description>Are you ready to make some noise?

These birds circle through the air in groups of up to 15, and at night, snuggle together in tree cavities. Their song is as unique as their look—a high squeaky note that sounds like &amp;#39;seek,&amp;#39; sometimes a &amp;#39;purr&amp;#39; or even a raspy &amp;#39;grhhrr.&amp;#39; Although deforestation and hunting pose threats to these birds, they are not endangered.

Meerkats live in mobs, tight-knit groups of up to 30 individuals that forage together, groom each other, and take turns watching for predators. These critters create huge burrows where they spend the night and retreat to escape the midday heat.</description></item><item><title>Ghosts of cities past</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.italicaruins_en-us4110786318_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.italicaruins_en-us4110786318_uhd/</guid><description>It was the year 206 BCE.

According to legend, a Hindu priest, Rsi Markandaya, arrived at the island of Bali in the 8th century, discovering an area abundant in medicinal herbs and plants. The village&amp;#39;s name derives from the word &amp;#39;ubad,&amp;#39; meaning medicine. Nestled within the verdant landscape, the village is rich in Hindu temples and local mythology. The mythical character seen in today’s image is Barong, a panther-like creature, the king of spirits, and a symbol of good fortune and prosperity.

Let the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore transport you through time. More than just a church, this Gothic structure, with its red-tiled dome, is steeped in centuries of history. Built over an older cathedral, construction began in 1296 under the supervision of architect Arnolfo di Cambio. Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi engineered its dome, the largest brick dome ever constructed. Its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral&amp;#39;s construction. It&amp;#39;s not just the outside that dazzles; inside there are artistic treasures to discover, from Giorgio Vasari&amp;#39;s fresco &amp;#39;The Last Judgment&amp;#39; to Paolo Uccello&amp;#39;s intricate clock face.

Today&amp;#39;s image features the Kokino megalithic observatory, part of a wider archaeological site in North Macedonia. It is believed that it marked the position of the sun during summer and winter solstices, as well as the equinox, and consists of two platforms. A stone block on the upper platform of the observatory indicates the summer solstice sunrise direction when seen from a seat on the lower platform.

Lupines were introduced here in the 1940s for their soil-binding properties, to reduce erosion. The plant flourishes in sandy and salty soils and spreads rapidly, bringing hues of purple, pink, and blue. Although some consider lupine to be a threat to native plants, it is welcomed by many as a cherished part of the summer landscape.

It was in pre-colonial Hawaii, however, that modern surfing was born. Here, people started to stand on their boards and to surf for fun. Historians believe that surfing made its way to the US in 1885, when three teenage Hawaiian princes surfed on redwood boards while on a break from boarding school in California.</description></item><item><title>Long may it wave</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.flagsdc_en-us9363778856_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.flagsdc_en-us9363778856_uhd/</guid><description>Wave our national symbol today; it&amp;#39;s Flag Day!

Featured here is a group of gemsboks, a large antelope, reigning over the sprawling savannas in southwestern Africa. Indigenous to the arid territories of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and parts of Zimbabwe, they thrive mainly within the Kalahari and Namib Deserts. They can survive in extremely dry conditions and can go without water for weeks, getting moisture from the food they eat. Moreover, gemsboks are adept runners, achieving speeds of up to 37 miles per hour. Their distinguishing trait is their notably elongated, straight horns. Although both genders possess these formidable defenses, the females&amp;#39; horns tend to be slightly longer and sleeker while the males&amp;#39; horns are thicker with broader bases. So, if you ever find yourself in the sandy plains of the Kalahari, keep an eye out for these desert gems.</description></item><item><title>City of neon dreams</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.osakanight_en-us7022302235_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.osakanight_en-us7022302235_uhd/</guid><description>In the heart of Japan, where the past and future intertwine, lies a city pulsating with life and culture\u2014Osaka.

Chestnut-headed bee-eaters spend their days swooping after stinging insects. As well as bees, they also feast on wasps, hornets, and other bugs. The birds in today&amp;#39;s image are in Bardia National Park in Nepal, but they&amp;#39;re found across many other South Asian countries, from India and Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Thailand. They catch their prey in mid-flight, returning to a perch where they beat insects to stun them and remove the stinger, which makes them safe to eat. These birds are designed to hunt: Their dazzling green plumage helps camouflage them in dappled jungle light, their curved beak is perfect for picking off insects with precision, and their eyes can move individually, which makes them all the better for spotting bees.</description></item><item><title>'Two' tired for a ride</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.copenhagenbicycles_en-us6431027482_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.copenhagenbicycles_en-us6431027482_uhd/</guid><description>Bicycles are the best!

Taking place in the first full week of June, this event was created by the National Garden Clubs, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the joys of horticulture. First celebrated in 1987 this week is all about getting more people involved in gardening and spreading awareness of how important gardens are. Being home to a wide range of trees, flowers, shrubs, and grasses, gardens can help the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide, filtering water, and encouraging insect life. Gardening clubs across the country celebrate this week by organizing workshops, visiting public gardens, or placing plants at public facilities. They&amp;#39;re also great for people; tending to a garden is good exercise, and being outside in the sunshine is a great way to get more vitamin D. Gardening can even boost your mood, helping you to feel more relaxed and peaceful.</description></item><item><title>Pride Month</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.pridemonthsf_en-us6251373281_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.pridemonthsf_en-us6251373281_uhd/</guid><description>June is Pride Month, commemorating the Stonewall uprising, a series of protests by the LGBTQIA+ community that took place on June 28, 1969, in response to a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village in New York City.

It would be another 13 years before enough land was acquired to make the park a reality but today, it encapsulates the largest subtropical wilderness in the US. Spanning more than 1.5 million acres, the park is a lifeline to 36 federally protected and endangered wildlife species, from the gentle manatee to the stealthy Florida panther. Here, the air thrums with the calls of over 350 bird species like limpkins and snail kites, while the waters teem with life including hundreds of species of fish, sea turtles, and American crocodiles. Beyond its biodiversity, the park is celebrated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve, and a Wetland of International Importance.

What exactly is biodiversity? It refers to the variety of living things, from animals and plants to fungi and microorganisms, in one area. This delicate but vigorous balance in nature is what keeps us all alive. That&amp;#39;s definitely worth celebrating! May 22 was named International Day for Biological Diversity by the United Nations in 2000. Unfortunately, the biodiversity of Earth is slowly decreasing due to climate change, the draining of natural resources, urbanization, and pollution, among other factors. Campaigners are urging governments, businesses and individuals to take action to boost biodiversity, to protect healthy ecosystems that supply us with water, food, medicines, and more.

Here, ancient buildings stand along the coastline of the Ligurian Sea, and life is filled with the hustle and bustle of the fishing industry. Vernazza got its name from the indigenous wine, &amp;#39;vernaccia,&amp;#39; meaning &amp;#39;local&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;ours.&amp;#39; One of the best-known monuments in the area is the medieval Doria Castle, built as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The car-free cobblestone streets are ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio.

A number of these Australian marsupials escaped from a nearby private zoo in the 1930s, and there are still recorded sightings of the descendants of the original wallabies.</description></item><item><title>Happy Cinco de Mayo!</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.sanmiguelallende_en-us9621237021_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.sanmiguelallende_en-us9621237021_uhd/</guid><description>Today&amp;#39;s homepage takes us to the Mexican city of San Miguel de Allende, to toast Cinco de Mayo, or &amp;#39;Fifth of May.&amp;#39; Not to be confused with Mexico&amp;#39;s Independence Day, Cinco de Mayo instead marks Mexico’s 1862 triumph over France at the Battle of Puebla. The holiday is observed in Mexico but has become popular in the US since the 1980s thanks to various advertising campaigns.

Many will recognize Skellig Michael, the island on our homepage, as the location of scenes from the &amp;#39;Star Wars&amp;#39; sequels, &amp;#39;The Force Awakens&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;The Last Jedi.&amp;#39; This UNESCO World Heritage Site appears in the movies as the planet Ahch-To, where Jedi master Luke Skywalker seeks refuge. Home to a 6th-century monastery with beehive huts and stone staircases, it also hosts a large seabird population that inspired the penguin-like porgs that roost on Ahch-To. Skellig Michael is about 7 miles off Ireland&amp;#39;s southwestern coast, daily visitors are limited, and boat trips are canceled if it is too stormy. Still, the island attracts &amp;#39;Star Wars&amp;#39; fans and others keen to see this ancient site, not so very far, far away.</description></item><item><title>A hot spot for wildflowers</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.sonoranspring_en-us9207877073_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.sonoranspring_en-us9207877073_uhd/</guid><description>Welcome to the Sonoran Desert, where life thrives despite the heat thanks to two seasons of rainfall. This subtropical desert spreads across parts of Mexico, California, and Arizona and is home to animals such as roadrunners, Gila monsters, and the Morafka&amp;#39;s desert tortoise. Its rainy seasons are followed by the blossoming of colorful wildflowers such as the brittlebush, seen in today&amp;#39;s image. These hardy shrubs are adapted to the dry seasons, with their silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Brittlebushes produce bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding splashes of color to the desert landscape. Another drought-loving desert flora is the saguaro cactus, which can live for over 150 years and grow up to 40 feet tall. The saguaro also provides food and shelter for desert species and is a sacred plant in the culture of the Tohono O&amp;#39;odham people.</description></item><item><title>To the moon and back</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.cratersofthemoon_en-us6516727783_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.cratersofthemoon_en-us6516727783_uhd/</guid><description>Buckle up, Earthlings, as you venture into an extraterrestrial realm right here on our planet!

Birds come in a wide range of sizes, colors, and behaviors, making them one of the most diverse groups of animals on Earth—from imposing eagles to today&amp;#39;s tiny snowy-winged star, a leucistic Anna&amp;#39;s hummingbird in the Australian Garden at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. These hummingbirds are typically vibrant in color, but leucism means some have decreased pigmentation, resulting in a paler appearance. Unlike albino birds, these hummingbirds do not have red or pink eyes. Their lighter plumage reduces protective camouflage, making them more vulnerable to predators such as hawks and feral cats.</description></item><item><title>For tree's a jolly good fellow</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.kalalochtree_en-us5565386489_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.kalalochtree_en-us5565386489_uhd/</guid><description>The first Arbor Day in the US was held in 1872.

Despite their small size, Adélie penguins are sleek swimmers and can dive as deep as 575 feet in search of shrimp-like krill or fish. They are social animals that gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting, and protection.

Lying on a narrow strip of land between two lochs, the site initially comprised 60 stones, although today only 36 remain. The exact purpose of the structure is still unknown, despite an excavation project at the site in 2008. In 1999, the Heart of Neolithic Orkney group of monuments, which includes the Ring of Brodgar, was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Bowling Ball Beach on the Mendocino Coast in California is named after the striking rock formations strewn across the shore. These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils. The answer, however, is quite simple: it is the forces of nature at play.</description></item><item><title>Canopy of blossoms</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.springapple_en-us3148648329_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.springapple_en-us3148648329_uhd/</guid><description>In this picturesque orchard, spring heralds the blossoming of apple trees.

Today, you can witness a rare celestial event—a total solar eclipse! As the moon perfectly aligns between the Earth and the sun, daylight will shift eerily to twilight. The total solar eclipse will be visible across North America, from Mazatlán, Mexico, to eastern Canada&amp;#39;s Newfoundland Island, for up to four and a half minutes between 10:57 AM PST and 4:47 PM ADT. It will be the first total solar eclipse visible in the continental United States since August 21, 2017, although one occurs somewhere on Earth approximately every 18 months. Astronomers study the sun&amp;#39;s corona, which is the outermost part of its atmosphere, its magnetic fields, and the behavior of Earth&amp;#39;s atmosphere during the eclipse. Keep an eye on the time today and find a good spot to put on eclipse-safe solar glasses and see the golden ring emerge.</description></item><item><title>Look, I'm a branch manager!</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.beaverdenali_en-us1894047698_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.beaverdenali_en-us1894047698_uhd/</guid><description>Known as nature&amp;#39;s engineers, beavers have been shaping the world for millions of years. Historically, North American beavers faced challenges from humans. They were hunted for their fur, and their &amp;#39;nuisance&amp;#39; freshwater abodes were destroyed. However, these buck-toothed, paddle-tailed dam builders have been gaining new respect in recent years. These animals have beneficial effects not only on water quality but also on land. With their iron-coated orange incisors, beavers fell trees, diligently constructing not just homes but habitats. Their dams create life-sustaining wetlands for countless species. Meanwhile, their lodges are masterpieces of security and comfort, the entrance strategically submerged to deter predators and provide privacy. The rodents have no trouble getting in, as they can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes. So, &amp;#39;woodn&amp;#39;t&amp;#39; it be nice to give a shout-out to these creatures on International Beaver Day?</description></item><item><title>A royal view</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.japanhimeji_en-us1768279571_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.japanhimeji_en-us1768279571_uhd/</guid><description>From Strawberry Day to Cat Day and even Vegetable Day, Japan has a list of faux holidays, which are the clever results of &amp;#39;dajare&amp;#39; or word plays.

Despite being larger than many other tree-dwelling mammals, three-toed sloths have adapted by reducing their muscle mass and size to thrive on treetops. Their large stomachs have four chambers, which, when full, account for about 30% of their body weight. These shaggy critters are so sedentary that algae grow on their coats, which helps to camouflage them within the rainforest canopy.

The 91-foot-tall white tower has guided sailors since its completion in 1809; it provides safe passage for ships on the Dublin-Holyhead-Liverpool route. When it was built, sperm whale oil was used to light the lamps; however, over the years, the mechanism has been upgraded to more advanced technology like LED bulbs and Fresnel lenses. Automated in 1984, the lighthouse continues to serve as a vital navigational aid, with its powerful beam shining up to 28 miles.

Did you know that when your clock strikes 1:59 today, you will be three decimal places closer to the real value of pi? Pi is everywhere, even in nature. Pictured here is a bodhi tree which has grown over an arch into the shape of the pi symbol at Wat Phra Ngam, a temple in Ayutthaya, Thailand. Whether you&amp;#39;re a math geek or just in it for the treats, Pi Day is for everyone to enjoy!</description></item><item><title>Bird's-eye view</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.magadiflamingos_en-us1720896379_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.magadiflamingos_en-us1720896379_uhd/</guid><description>What an unearthly view! This aerial photograph shows a flamboyance of lesser flamingos against the backdrop of Lake Magadi in Kenya. The lesser flamingo is one of six species of flamingo, a bird known for its vibrant pink plumage and distinctive feeding behavior. They use their specialized beaks to filter algae near the water&amp;#39;s surface and are often found in African soda lakes like Lake Magadi, which are brimming with cyanobacteria and algae for them to eat. The spectacle of thousands of these avian wonders congregating at the lake reveals the importance of these unique ecosystems.</description></item><item><title>Guardians of the canyon</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.brycesnow_en-us1471442313_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.brycesnow_en-us1471442313_uhd/</guid><description>These fascinating red hoodoos of Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah are best explored on foot! The park&amp;#39;s hiking trails guide you among the world&amp;#39;s largest collection of hoodoos, which are rock spires formed by erosion. The horseshoe-shaped natural amphitheaters create a surreal landscape that changes with the play of sunlight. The area was initially inhabited by Native American tribes, including the Paiute people. Although there is no evidence of them having lived there permanently, Paiute Indians used the Paunsaugunt Plateau for seasonal hunting and gathering. Designated a national park in 1928, Bryce Canyon is dotted with several viewpoints like Inspiration Point, Yovimpa Point, and Rainbow Point, which offer panoramic vistas of the surrounding topography.</description></item><item><title>Sweet dreams are made of leaves</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.sleepykoala_en-us1399776436_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.sleepykoala_en-us1399776436_uhd/</guid><description>Feeling sluggish from the effects of daylight saving time? Don&amp;#39;t worry, National Napping Day has you covered! This holiday, introduced in 1999 by Boston University professor William Anthony and his wife, Camille, promotes naps and their short-term benefits to mental alertness. Take a cue from today&amp;#39;s image; this sleepy koala may inspire you to catch some Z&amp;#39;s. These adorable Australian marsupials can sleep up to 20 hours a day, which helps them conserve the little energy they get from their eucalyptus-based diet. Koalas move slowly when awake, spend most of their time tucked into nooks in trees, and have a lower body temperature than other animals of their size. Let&amp;#39;s find some time today to sneak off to a peaceful spot to experience the benefits of Napping Day.</description></item><item><title>Time to change the time</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.beaumontclock_en-us1267001824_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.beaumontclock_en-us1267001824_uhd/</guid><description>Time is of the essence today: The second Sunday of March marks the start of daylight saving time. At 2 AM the clocks sprang forward one hour, meaning there will be an extra hour of daylight this evening. While Benjamin Franklin is often credited with inventing daylight saving, the first real proposal for changing the clocks came in 1895 from New Zealand entomologist George Hudson, who valued having more daylight so he could collect insects after work.</description></item><item><title>Transformed by time</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bistiblue_en-us1090853434_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bistiblue_en-us1090853434_uhd/</guid><description>Time is the great transformer, changing the world and all of us. For instance, this New Mexico badland—the Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness—was once a lush, tropical forest. Nearly 70 million years ago, instead of twisted terrains and towering spires, this place was home to an array of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs, including armored Ankylosaurs, duck-billed Hadrosaurs, and mighty Tyrannosaurs. Today, the area is filled with wonders of a different kind, rock formations that look more like sculptures than natural phenomena. Bisti/De-Na-Zin is named after Navajo words: Bisti means &amp;#39;among the adobe formations,&amp;#39; and De-Na-Zin means &amp;#39;standing crane,&amp;#39; a reference to nearby rock carvings of the bird. Visitors to the Four Corners region shouldn&amp;#39;t miss out on this otherworldly landscape of shale and sandstone.</description></item><item><title>Right to shine</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.tatelightup_en-us0656439011_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.tatelightup_en-us0656439011_uhd/</guid><description>Happy International Women&amp;#39;s Day!

Overlooking the vast wetlands of the Ebro Delta, the peak offers views of streams and pine forests, with trails that lead into the mountains. The word &amp;#39;Benet&amp;#39; comes from Arabic, hinting at the area&amp;#39;s varied past, including both Arabic and Christian settlers. These days, the park is home to a variety of wildlife, from ibex and otters to vultures and eagles. Animals aren&amp;#39;t the only inhabitants of the area. The villages nestled at the base of this massif still maintain their shared traditions, such as the age-old craft of using vegetable fibers to create baskets and kitchen utensils.</description></item><item><title>Get your splash on</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.wahclellafalls_en-us4371863309_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.wahclellafalls_en-us4371863309_uhd/</guid><description>Nestled in the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon, there&amp;#39;s something special awaiting hikers: the Wahclella Falls. Fed by Tanner Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River, these waterfalls were named after a Native American village by members of the Mazama Mountaineering Club. At the end of a trail, visitors can see the spectacular two-tiered cascade that crashes down 350 feet into a pool below, which is the perfect place to take a dip and cool off. While you&amp;#39;re swimming, keep an eye out for the water ouzel—also known as the American dipper—a species of bird that lives here. They can be spotted flying along the stream and occasionally diving into the water.</description></item><item><title>Stuck in a loop?</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bangkokcircle_en-us4243452532_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bangkokcircle_en-us4243452532_uhd/</guid><description>In vibrant Thailand, the city of Bangkok pulses with life! Covering an area of more than 600 square miles, it is estimated that over 10 million people live there, roughly 15% of the country&amp;#39;s population. The capital city is home to a bustling urban infrastructure, featuring a complex network of traffic circles and highways. In 1864, the completion of Charoen Krung Road marked a turn in the city&amp;#39;s transit by serving as a pioneering construction project utilizing Western techniques. The introduction of a complex elevated expressway network in 1972 and the Don Mueang Tollway has made it easier to drive in and out of the city. Over the years, the road network has evolved to meet the demands of this sprawling urban expanse.</description></item><item><title>A sleeping beauty</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.arenalcostarica_en-us4075825664_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.arenalcostarica_en-us4075825664_uhd/</guid><description>Greetings from tropical Costa Rica! The conical Arenal Volcano rises to an impressive height of 5,437 feet, standing tall above the surrounding rainforest and Lake Arenal, the largest lake in the country. The sleepy mountain roared to life in a massive 1968 eruption that buried about 6 square miles under rocks, lava, and ash and devastated three villages. The last significant volcanic activity there took place in 2010, and the once lava-lit peak is currently dormant. With over 500 species of birds, Arenal Volcano National Park is a must-visit location for birdwatchers. The park is also home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including red brocket deer, pumas, white-faced monkeys, orchids, heliconias, and ferns. Arenal makes for an imposing and beautiful sight, towering over the tropical trees.</description></item><item><title>A dappled acrobat</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.krugerleopard_en-us3980767237_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.krugerleopard_en-us3980767237_uhd/</guid><description>It&amp;#39;s time to step into the wild!

However, on the island of Sicily lies a less famous gem—Modica. It&amp;#39;s a city that rose from the rubble of an earthquake in 1693 to become an architectural wonderland of Baroque-style buildings. With fewer than 60,000 inhabitants, this UNESCO World Heritage Site boasts cobbled lanes, echoing with powerful footprints—from prehistoric tribes to the ancient Greeks and Romans to the medieval Arabs and Normans. Landmarks like the San Giorgio Cathedral and San Pietro Church awe visitors with their grandeur, and Modica&amp;#39;s famous chocolate, crafted with Aztec-inspired techniques, tempts the palates of food enthusiasts. So, the next time Italy beckons, how about taking the road less traveled to Modica?</description></item><item><title>And the march goes on</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.suffrageparade_en-us3648247280_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.suffrageparade_en-us3648247280_uhd/</guid><description>Every March, we celebrate Women&amp;#39;s History Month, a tribute to the generations of women who have shaped our past and are inspiring our present. Today, let&amp;#39;s take a moment to highlight a crucial step that was taken for a more representative democracy—the women&amp;#39;s suffrage movement. This image shows a sea of determined faces in a 1915 Manhattan suffrage parade. Pioneers like Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone spearheaded this effort, which culminated in the historic 19th Amendment in 1920, which granted women the right to vote. Over a hundred years later, women now hold 28% of seats in Congress, a dramatic leap forward from the past and a reminder of progress still to be made.</description></item><item><title>Leaping through an extra day</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.leapingsquirrel_en-us3514581405_uhd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.leapingsquirrel_en-us3514581405_uhd/</guid><description>Are you a &amp;#39;leapling&amp;#39;? No, not like this Eurasian red squirrel; rather, that&amp;#39;s the term for anyone born on leap day. A leap year is a calendar oddity that exists because Earth&amp;#39;s orbit and our usual year count are slightly out of sync. Earth takes 365.25 days to revolve around the sun. To compensate for those extra 5 hours, February gets an extra day—leap day—every four years. The concept, dating back to the ancient Romans, was refined in the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. While the purpose of the day is to keep our year aligned with the solar calendar, it can also serve as an extra day to prepare for spring! Cultures worldwide mark leap days and years with unique customs. In Ireland and Britain, women propose to men, in Greece, marrying during a leap year is said to bring misfortune, and in France, a satirical newspaper is published.</description></item><item><title>Grow with the flow</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bamburghcastleuk_en-us3358821704_uhd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.bamburghcastleuk_en-us3358821704_uhd/</guid><description>Bamburgh Castle perches on a crag of volcanic rock, overlooking sand dunes and the coast of Northumberland, England. The fortress, once a strategic Anglo-Saxon stronghold, evolved over centuries into the imposing structure seen today. The site was the seat of the ancient Northumbrian kingdom—an early medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom covering present-day northern England and southeast Scotland. The original castle was destroyed by invading Vikings in 993 and a new castle was built here by the Normans. Today&amp;#39;s castle is the result of various restorations in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries. After surviving its share of attacks, Bamburgh Castle has made its way to the limelight due to its impressive silhouette against the North Sea, featuring in productions like &amp;#39;Macbeth,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Ivanhoe.&amp;#39;</description></item><item><title>An ice day to play</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.polarbearcubs_en-us3160537454_uhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.polarbearcubs_en-us3160537454_uhd/</guid><description>Bear with us as we head north for International Polar Bear Day, highlighting the challenges faced by the world&amp;#39;s largest bear species.

It&amp;#39;s been 105 years since this Arizona landmark was designated a national park by President Woodrow Wilson in 1919. The origins of this exceptional landscape, carved by the Colorado River, wind, and landslides, date back up to 6 million years. Alongside its steep valleys and colorful rock formations, the canyon holds the stories of Native Americans, European, and American pioneers—the oldest human artifacts found here date back nearly 12,000 years. In addition to tourist adventures such as cruising on the Colorado River, joining the Trail of Time walking tour, or climbing up to the Desert View Watchtower, the park is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a registered International Dark Sky Park for crystal-clear stargazing.</description></item><item><title>Say it loud</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.wrightsculpture_en-us2897504160_uhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.wrightsculpture_en-us2897504160_uhd/</guid><description>Though we are nearing the end of Black History Month, the legacy of Black artists stands tall throughout the year. Today we are highlighting the works of Charles McGee, a painter, sculptor, and educator from Detroit, whose works are found all over the Motor City. The 20-foot-tall sculpture seen here, &amp;#39;United We Stand,&amp;#39; represents themes of togetherness, unity, and balance and sits outside the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. McGee&amp;#39;s pieces, which he produced up until his death in 2021, often feature abstract collections of lines, patterns, and allusions to nature, either in striking black and white or vibrant colors. He is one of many Black artists who have left an indelible mark on the great canvas of American art, along with others such as Joshua Johnson, Edmonia Lewis, Jacob Lawrence, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kara Walker, and Kehinde Wiley.</description></item><item><title>Whispers of spring</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.almondbloom_en-us2721273642_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.almondbloom_en-us2721273642_uhd/</guid><description>In the sun-kissed orchards of the Golden State, almonds reign supreme, enticing the taste buds and adorning the natural surroundings. California grows about 80% of the world&amp;#39;s almonds and 100% of those produced commercially in the United States. Almonds have heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and are nutritional powerhouses, packed with fiber, protein, and an array of vitamins and minerals. During February and March, in California&amp;#39;s Central Valley, these seeds—not nuts—emerge from the delicate blossoms of the almond tree and mature within a protective, fuzzy hull. The trees, which belong to the rose family, burst into a spectacle of beauty during full bloom, with fragrant flowers painting the orchards in hues of white and pink.</description></item><item><title>Where eagles dance</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.haghartsinmonastery_en-us2523109486_uhd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.haghartsinmonastery_en-us2523109486_uhd/</guid><description>Hidden among the forests of northern Armenia, Haghartsin Monastery is a gem of medieval Armenian architecture.

The seemingly impossible can be found at this time of year on the eastern side of El Capitan, Yosemite National Park&amp;#39;s famous rock face. Horsetail Fall is a seasonal waterfall that flows only when there has been plenty of snowfall, and when temperatures have been warm enough to melt it. For a couple of weeks in February, if skies are clear, water is flowing, and the sun shines at just the right angle, the long, slender waterfall takes on a glowing, flame-hued appearance. Hundreds gather in Yosemite Valley to see this mesmerizing natural spectacle. The phenomenon has earned the moniker &amp;#39;firefall,&amp;#39; an homage to the historic Yosemite Firefall, a manmade event from the top of the park&amp;#39;s Glacier Point that took place between 1872 to 1968.

At around 2,087 feet, Kinder Scout is the park&amp;#39;s highest point and its rugged moorlands and windswept plateaus have drawn walkers and nature enthusiasts for generations. In 1932, it was the stage for a &amp;#39;mass trespass,&amp;#39; in which hundreds of people on foot protested for public access to these lands. At the time, many areas of open countryside were closed to the British public. This act of civil disobedience prompted much public sympathy, which eventually led to the establishment of the UK&amp;#39;s first national parks. The Peak District National Park was the first, designated in April 1951, ensuring that these hills and valleys would be preserved for future generations to enjoy.</description></item><item><title>A tribute at twilight</title><link>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.lincolnsunset_en-us8001542624_uhd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pixel-wallpaper.github.io/posts/ohr.lincolnsunset_en-us8001542624_uhd/</guid><description>The United States of America has had 46 commanders in chief, and today, the third Monday of February, we commemorate their legacies.

His observations on the remote volcanic islands in the eastern Pacific Ocean would help him to develop his famous theory of evolution through natural selection.
